identityAFRICA on Governance Hacks by Africa Hacks, June 17th-24th, 2021
Update and submit document: How can blockchain technology be used in your project?
We will be using Chimoney API for a reward system for citizens/volunteers engagement in tracking, impact scoring, monitoring and evaluation of funded projects. Chimoney API leveraging blockchain technology in ensuring disbursement of data/airtime/money/crypto to large numbers of citizens/volunteers engaged in ongoing projects.
How can your project be improved with AI or Data Science?
AI for data capturing, verification and authentication of identity, to matching biodata, faces and fingerprints to the database to prevent fraud, corruption and diversion.
AI/Data Science will help in verification and fraud detection. One of the main pillar of identityAFRICA is identity verification, aside from the process of biometric and data capturing, in order to train the machine learning model to have more pointers (indications). Artificial intelligence (AI) would help to train the machine learning model based on captured data in order to give alternative solutions to fraud detection aside from biometric (thumb print) of the partners involved in project implementation.

Geo-tagging will prevent fraud, fake M & E process and impact scoring and Chimoney API for rewards systems.
The technologies are used in development of identityAFRICA are: python/django, html, css, javal script, nodejs/express, MySQL, vue, mongodb,
Application Programming Interface (APIs): Chimoney, NIN, Africa’s Talking, NIBSS, BVN, Flutterwave/Paystack/PayPal, UareU fingerprint,
- What solutions exist that are similar? VerifyMe, BudgIT, Tracka, Eduplana, Citizen Gavel, Follow The Money,
 
- How is your solution different? Data Credibility, Digital Identity, Process Management, Monitoring & Evaluation, improves efficiency and increase project delivery
(Tracking, evaluation, citizens engagement and impact scoring platform, leveraging data analytics, geo tagging and AI to verify identity of contractor, MDA in charge as supervisor, community representatives, Local/State/FG elected official that facilitates the projects. We will be using Chimoney API as a reward system for citizens/volunteers)
 
Problem Statement:
The impact-focused projects cannot be accounted for by the public officials/contractors because no platform has their previous records and history. This results in lack of process management, corporate social responsibility (CSR)/ impact scoring, tracking, evaluation, monitoring and inclusiveness of the citizens that projects are facilitated by private/public organisations. We are building identityAFRICA, a web and mobile app to solve highlighted problems and make it possible to track the funded project and
Timeline
identityAFRICA …ensuring/facilitating process for citizens’ inclusiveness OR identityAFRICA …empowering citizens for accountability and impact scoring
 
Suggestion: This is much better. You started with the problem, solution and potential impact. To highlight the impact, numbers are good like with identityAFRICA, Y % of funded projects will be tracked by YEAR. And the confidence of citizens will be increased by X times (edited)
 
CORE problem the app will be solving are: credibility check, citizens feedback and rewards, corporate social responsibility, impact scoring and measurement systems, evaluation and tracking system, 
Benefits: Prevent fund misappropriation, avoidance of partiality in rewarding contracts, tools for promoting good governance, transparency, open governance, processes, accountability, impact scoring, citizens’ participation and rewards system
